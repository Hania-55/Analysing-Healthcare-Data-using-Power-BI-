# 📊 DataCamp Case Study: Analyzing Healthcare Data in Power BI

This repository showcases my completion of the **DataCamp case study on healthcare analytics**, where I built interactive dashboards in **Power BI** to analyze hospital performance . The project demonstrates my ability to apply **data modeling, DAX, and visualization techniques** to uncover actionable insights.

## 🚀 Dashboards

### 🏥 LOS Comparison
- Analyzed average length of stay (LOS) across 151 hospitals and 26K discharges.
- Identified key influencers reducing LOS: *Osteoarthritis diagnoses*, *minor illness severity*, and *home health disposition*.
- Visualized top and bottom performers using combined bar and line charts.

### 💰 Cost Comparison
- Explored average cost per discharge, highlighting financial outliers and cost‑saving factors.
- Created scatter plots comparing LOS and cost across health service areas.
- Found that *minor risk of mortality* and *smaller surgical programs* were associated with lower costs.

### 🏨 Hospital Profile
- Built dynamic hospital profiles to benchmark facilities against statewide averages.
- Example: *University Hospital* showed higher‑than‑average LOS and cost, with most discharges linked to *minor severity* and *home health disposition*.
- Used donut charts, bar graphs, and circular gauges for intuitive storytelling.
